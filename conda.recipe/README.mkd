# Building instructions


Change to the `conda.recipies` directory. Run
```bash
$ conda install conda-build
```
to acquire the conda build tools. Then you can build with
```bash
conda build --python 3.5 .
```
and pay attention to the output directory. You should see something that looks like
```
anaconda upload //anaconda/conda-bld/osx-64/plumbum-v1.6.3-py35_0.tar.bz2
```

Now, you will need to convert to other architectures. On non-Windows systems:
```
conda convert --platform all //anaconda/conda-bld/osx-64/plumbum-v1.6.3-py35_0.tar.bz2 -o outputdir\

```
and Windows users will need to add a `-f`.

Rerun the following steps for all python versions.


To upload packages,
```bash
conda install anaconda-client
anaconda login
for f in `ls outputdir/*/*.tar.bz2`; do anaconda upload $f; done
anaconda logout
```
