  in a new session (``setsid`` on POSIX, ``CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`` on Windows)
* ``Command.Popen``: args can now also be a list (previously, it was required to be a tuple). See
* ``local.daemonize``: run commands as full daemons (double-fork and ``setsid``) on POSIX systems, or

  (`#46 <https://github.com/tomerfiliba/plumbum/pull/46>`_)

1.0.1
-----
