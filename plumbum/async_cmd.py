"""Async command module for convenient imports.

This module provides a convenient way to import async local commands directly::

    from plumbum.async_cmd import ls, grep, echo

    async def main():
        result = await ls("-la")
        print(result)

        # Pipeline support
        output = await (ls | grep["py"])()
        print(output)

This is the async equivalent of plumbum.cmd, using the same module-hack pattern
to allow direct imports of commands as async versions.
