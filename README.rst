Plumbum: Shell Combinators
==========================

Ever wished the wrist-handiness of shell scripts be put into a **real** programming language? 
Say hello to *Plumbum Shell Combinators*. Plumbum (Latin for *lead*, which was used to create 
pipes back in the day) is a small yet feature-rich library for shell script-like programs in Python. 
The motto of the library is **"Never write shell scripts again"**, and thus it attempts to mimic 
the **shell syntax** ("shell combinators") where it makes sense, while keeping it all **Pythonic 
and cross-platform**.

Apart from shell-like syntax and handy shortcuts, the library provides local and remote command 
execution (over SSH), local and remote file-system paths, easy working-directory and environment 
manipulation, and a programmatic Command-Line Interface (CLI) application toolkit. 
Now let's see some code!
